Plants vs. (Quarantine) Zombies
This is sort of like plants vs. zombies, except more quarantine themed.
It works sort of like regular plants vs zombies, but with funnier graphics (like collecting toilet paper instead of sun,
because...you know thatâ€™s clearly the most important thing to get a hold of), and I also modified the zombies/plants to
fit with the quarantine theme using Photoshop.
You have to defend yourself from the zombies by planting plants which will attack the zombies.

1. install pygame
2. make sure all the pictures, music, tp3_pz, cmu_112_graphics, and leaderboard are in the same folder as tp3_main
3. run the tp3_main
4. press space bar to pause and unpause the cheerful music (only works in game mode).
Splashscreen mode also has q for standard play mode, r to see scores, and p for scoring mode.
Watch demo video (mp4) to get to know some of the features.

Thank you!
